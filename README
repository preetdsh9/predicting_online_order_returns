As people who shop regularly from Amazon, we often wonder how much does it cost Amazon to restock those products. This is what initially sparked our interest and motivated us to pursue this project about predicting whether a customer will return a product.\n","\n","After further research about this we found that this is a huge issue for retailers in terms of net margins from online sales. Below we have outlined the major issues faced by the retailers:\n","\n","1) According to [KPMG](https://medium.com/sizolution/the-problem-of-returning-clothes-to-online-stores-89ddf3854f5d), the cost of handling a return can be as high as three times compared to the cost of delivery.\n","\n","2) According to a [Medium article](https://medium.com/sizolution/the-problem-of-returning-clothes-to-online-stores-89ddf3854f5d), retailers churn 31% of new customers and 8% of repeat buyers due to poor return services, and 20% of new customers report finding the returns process to be complicated. Hence, predicting returns in advance will help retailers forecast their inventory and also, place the right return services in place to reduce customer churn rate and increase net margins.\n","\n","3)  As per a [Barclays report](https://home.barclaycard/press-releases/), 57% of retailers say that dealing with returns has a negative impact on the day-to-day running of their business.\n","\n","4) Finally, according to a CNBC article, 25% (~5 billion pounds) of the returns end up in landfill.\n","\n","These are massive pain points for online retailers which have not been solved yet and our prediction tool will be a means to an end towards companies optimizing their return procedures. \n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-75GQpKmCPKR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Related Work**\n","\n","As mentioned above, our initial idea came from us wondering about the pain points for companies like Amazon when customers return their orders.
